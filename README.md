# How to set test name for automation test in Mocha-js on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=Mocha-js-set-testname)

To set test name for automation test in Mocha-js on LambdaTest, the following steps can be followed. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Mocha-selenium-sample).

## Steps

To set test name as method name in Mocha-js, change the 'name' attribute in the capabilites located at`conf/single.conf.js` like so:

```js
exports.capabilities = {
        'build': 'Mocha-Selenium-Sample', //Build name
        'name': 'Your Test Name', // Test name
        'platform':'Windows 10', // OS name
        'browserName': 'chrome', // Browser name
        'version': 'latest', // Browser version
        'visual': false,  // To take step by step screenshot
        'network':false,  // To capture network Logs
        'console':false, // To capture console logs.
        'tunnel': false, // If you want to run the localhost than change it to true
};
```

In the testfile, add the following code in the `beforeEach` function in the `describe` function definition:

```js
beforeEach(function(done) {
      //sets name of test
      caps.name = this.currentTest.title;
      driver = buildDriver(caps);
      done();
    });
```
## Run your test

```bash
npm run single
```
